# Tabber
Tabber is an application for transcribing Guitar tabulature into ASCII format. It is currently in early development.
The goal is to make a convenient means of creating, Storing, and sharing ASCii format guitar tabulature. Web based and mobile focused so you can get your ideas down before they leave you, wherever. Record sound clips, keep notes, and share your work.

# current build
Tabber is in a proof of concept stage. Currently working on getting the main functionality of the editor worked out. Interface mock-up was built on Mozilla and is not currently working on Chrome.
