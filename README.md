# Tabber
Tabber is an application for transcribing Guitar tabulature into ASCII format. It is currently in early development.
The goal is to make a convenient means of creating, Storing, and sharing ASCii format guitar tabulature. Web based and mobile focused so you can get your ideas down before they leave you, wherever. Record sound clips, keep notes, and share your work.

# current build
Tabber is currently in a proof of concept stage. The barebones interface of the editor is in place, but there is a lot to
be done before its a smooth experience.
The goal was to make navigation easy and eliminate the need to fill blank spcae as you normally would when building guitar tabs.
