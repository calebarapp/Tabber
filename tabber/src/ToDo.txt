Style: 
    - Make mobile friendly view. 
        - Have secondary control panel on bottom of the screen for mobile version. 
            - have multiple select for each string input.
            - have butttons for traversing columns left and right. 
            - button to traverse rows. 
            - Killswitch type button that you can hold while you traverse to highlight multiple columns.
            - copy, paste, insert, and cut.
Markup: 
    - Control Panel: 
        - copy, paste, cut, and insert buttons.
        - shift left and right buttons.
            - shifting right will push columns
            - shifting left will only work if columns to the left is empty.
Function: 
    - User should be able to copy, paste and cut selecitng from one or multiple columns.
        - User should be able to copy highlighted selection.
        - User should be able to paste over highlighted selection.
            - highlighting multiple should paste OVER selection.
            - pasting single should paste OVER selection. 
            - inserting single should paste after selection. 
    - Inputs should update each highlighted column if multiple are slected.

    Next: 
    line 22.
        - extract current code into a function.
         create another function for dealing with more than one selected column.
         current function will just control branching for selecting either of these methods. 
        - Issues: 
            - Last index of active Id gets set to first when input is filled in multiple select??
